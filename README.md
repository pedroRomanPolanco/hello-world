# hello-world
I am currently learning how to use github!

At time of writing, I am 22 years old.  I live with my family in the Providence, RI area.  I work part time at a bio-acoustics laboratory, am a part-time Master's degree student in electrical engineering, and I love to practice and perform music.  I have a passion for all things sound and signal related.  I feel comfortable using Matlab and python and next want to learn C++
